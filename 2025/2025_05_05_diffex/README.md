# Explaining in Diffusion - Explaining a Classifier Through Hierarchical Semantics with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models

Presentation introduces DiffEx, a method for explaining image classifier decisions using text-to-image diffusion models. By leveraging vision-language models, DiffEx builds a hierarchical semantic structure to identify and edit influential visual features without retraining. The approach is domain-agnostic, supports complex scenes, and enables both individual and joint attribute analysis.
